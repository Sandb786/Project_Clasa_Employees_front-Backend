1. MultipartFile objects

 Explaination:- Since MultipartFile objects often store uploaded files as temporary files, 
               they may be removed automatically once the request is complete, making tempFile invalid in the next request.

Solution:- Convert 'MultipartFile' to 'InputStream'

            {
             inputStream = file.getInputStream();

             filePath=Paths.get(path,file.getOriginalFilename());

             Files.copy(inputStream,filePath,StandardCopyOption.REPLACE_EXISTING)
            }

 Files.copy() :- Method to copy the InputStream directly to the file destination and replaces the file if it already exists. 
               This method is concise and leverages Java NIO for efficient file operation

 StandardCopyOption.REPLACE_EXISTING :-  Is an enum constant from the StandardCopyOption enum, which is part of the Java NIO (New Input/Output) library (java.nio.file package). 
                                       Enums in Java are special types used to define collections of constants,and StandardCopyOption is an enum that specifies various options 
                                       for file copy and move operation.
